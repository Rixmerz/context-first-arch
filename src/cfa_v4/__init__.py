"""
CFA v4 - Context-First Architecture (Simplified)

A minimalist approach: 4 tools, architecture over indexing.

Tools:
- cfa.onboard: Load project context
- cfa.remember: Store knowledge
- cfa.recall: Retrieve knowledge
- cfa.checkpoint: Git safe points

Philosophy: Good architecture makes indexing unnecessary.
